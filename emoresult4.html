                <p>It is normal for us to have bad moods and bad days, even bad weeks. However, it is important <br><br>
                that we are able to release the bad energy built up in our bodies so that we can move on. <br><br>
                We understand that you may not have someone to speak to regarding your issues, so we recommend<br><br>
                to consult various therapists. Remember, a bad day, week or even month does not mean a bad life. You got this!</p><br><br><br>
