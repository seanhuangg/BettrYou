                <p>It is natural and completely understandable to be down about your life right now, whether <br><br>
                it is from external or internal factors. We understand that you have hobbies or pastimes that can <br><br>
                potentially help you feel better, so we do recommend to indulge in those activities more often,<br><br>
                but instead of using it as an excape, use it to wind down from thinking about your problem all the time.</p>
