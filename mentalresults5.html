                <p>Losing interest in things you're normally interested in is definitely something to pay<br>
                    attention to, as it may be the first warning sign of developing depression. <br>
                    When faced with this challenge, it is important to ask yourself a few 'Why" questions.<br><br><br><br>
                1. Why do I not feel the same anymore? Is it the people that I'm around? Is it because I am not happy with myself?<br><br>
                2. Why did I pursue this hobby/pastime in the first place? Is it because it brought me something?<br><br>
                3. Why would other people lose their interest in this hobby, and how can I pick myself back up?</p>
